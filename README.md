# Global terrorism data analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and better understanding the pattern and trend of terrorism worldwide using data analytics techniques.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use demographic, geographic, and socio-economic data from countries where acts of terrorism occur to identify potential risk factors and conditions that may contribute to terrorism. In addition, the project will examine how terrorism has changed over time and is expected to change in the future using data visualization techniques in Power BI and time series analysis. The entire ETL process was performed in PowerQuery.

The project will also analyze patterns and trends in the frequency, severity, and type of acts of terrorism that occur in different parts of the world, and evaluate the effectiveness of the security policies and measures adopted by governments and other entities to prevent and combat terrorism.
